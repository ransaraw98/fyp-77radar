%% Introduction
% There are two categories of multiple input multiple output (MIMO) radars.
% Multistatic radars form the first category. They are often referred to as
% statistical MIMO radars. Coherent MIMO radars form the second category
% and are the focus of this example. A benefit of coherent MIMO radar
% signal processing is the ability to increase the angular resolution of
% the physical antenna array by forming a virtual array.

%% Virtual Array
% A virtual array can be created by quasi-monostatic MIMO radars, where the
% transmit and receive arrays are closely located. To better understand the
% virtual array concept, first look at the two-way pattern of a
% conventional phased array radar. The two-way pattern of a phased array
% radar is the product of its transmit array pattern and receive array
% pattern. For example, consider a 77 GHz millimeter wave radar with a
% 2-element transmit array and a 4-element receive array.
fc = 77e9;
c = 3e8;
lambda = c/fc;
Nt = 2;
Nr = 4;
%%
% If both arrays have half-wavelength spacing, which are sometimes referred
% to as full arrays, then the two-way pattern is close to the receive array
% pattern.
dt = lambda/2;
dr = lambda/2;

txarray = phased.ULA(Nt,dt);
rxarray = phased.ULA(Nr,dr);

ang = -90:90;

pattx = pattern(txarray,fc,ang,0,'Type','powerdb');
patrx = pattern(rxarray,fc,ang,0,'Type','powerdb');
pat2way = pattx+patrx;

helperPlotMultipledBPattern(ang,[pat2way pattx patrx],[-30 0],...
    {'Two-way Pattern','Tx Pattern','Rx Pattern'},...
    'Patterns of full/full arrays - 2Tx, 4Rx',...
    {'-','--','-.'});


%%
% If the full transmit array is replaced with a thin array, meaning the
% element spacing is wider than half wavelength, then the two-way pattern
% has a narrower beamwidth. Notice that even though the thin transmit array
% has grating lobes, those grating lobes are not present in the two-way
% pattern.
dt = Nr*lambda/2;
txarray = phased.ULA(Nt,dt);
pattx = pattern(txarray,fc,ang,0,'Type','powerdb');
pat2way = pattx+patrx;
helperPlotMultipledBPattern(ang,[pat2way pattx patrx],[-30 0],...
    {'Two-way Pattern','Tx Pattern','Rx Pattern'},...
    'Patterns of thin/full arrays - 2Tx, 4Rx',...
    {'-','--','-.'});

%%
% The two-way pattern of this system corresponds to the pattern of a
% virtual receive array with 2 x 4 = 8 elements. Thus, by carefully
% choosing the geometry of the transmit and the receive arrays, we can
% increase the angular resolution of the system without adding more
% antennas to the arrays.

varray = phased.ULA(Nt*Nr,dr);
patv = pattern(varray,fc,ang,0,'Type','powerdb');

%% Virtual Array in MIMO Radars
% In a coherent MIMO radar system, each antenna of the transmit array
% transmits an orthogonal waveform. Because of this orthogonality, it is
% possible to recover the transmitted signals at the receive array. The
% measurements at the physical receive array corresponding to each
% orthogonal waveform can then be stacked to form the measurements of the
% virtual array.
%
% <<../MIMORadarVirtualArray.png>>
%
% Note that since each element in the transmit array radiates
% independently, there is no transmit beamforming, so the transmit pattern
% is broad and covers a large field of view (FOV). This allows the
% simultaneous illumination of all targets in the FOV. The receive array
% can then generate multiple beams to process all target echoes. Compared
% to conventional phased array radars that need successive scans to cover
% the entire FOV, this is another advantage of MIMO radars for applications
% that require fast reaction time.

%% TDM-MIMO Radar Simulation
% Time division multiplexing (TDM) is one way to achieve orthogonality
% among transmit channels. The remainder of this example shows how to model
% and simulate a TDM-MIMO frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW)
% automotive radar system. The waveform characteristics are adapted from
% the <docid:radar_ug.example-ex11665805 Automotive Adaptive Cruise Control Using FMCW Technology> example.

waveform = helperDesignFMCWWaveform(c,lambda);
fs = waveform.SampleRate;

%%
% Imagine that there are two cars in the FOV with a separation of 20
% degrees. As seen in the earlier array pattern plots of this example, the
% 3dB beamwidth of a 4-element receive array is around 30 degrees so
% conventional processing would not be able to separate the two targets in
% the angular domain. The radar sensor parameters are as follows:

transmitter = phased.Transmitter('PeakPower',0.001,'Gain',36);
receiver = phased.ReceiverPreamp('Gain',40,'NoiseFigure',4.5,'SampleRate',fs);

txradiator = phased.Radiator('Sensor',txarray,'OperatingFrequency',fc,...
    'PropagationSpeed',c,'WeightsInputPort',true);

rxcollector = phased.Collector('Sensor',rxarray,'OperatingFrequency',fc,...
    'PropagationSpeed',c);
%%
% Define the position and motion of the ego vehicle and the two cars in the
% FOV.
radar_speed = 100*1000/3600;     % Ego vehicle speed 100 km/h
radarmotion = phased.Platform('InitialPosition',[0;0;0.5],'Velocity',[radar_speed;0;0]);

car_dist = [40 50];              % Distance between sensor and cars (meters)
car_speed = [-80 96]*1000/3600;  % km/h -> m/s
car_az = [-10 10];
car_rcs = [20 40];
car_pos = [car_dist.*cosd(car_az);car_dist.*sind(car_az);0.5 0.5];

cars = phased.RadarTarget('MeanRCS',car_rcs,'PropagationSpeed',c,'OperatingFrequency',fc);
carmotion = phased.Platform('InitialPosition',car_pos,'Velocity',[car_speed;0 0;0 0]);

%%
% The propagation model is assumed to be free space.
channel = phased.FreeSpace('PropagationSpeed',c,...
    'OperatingFrequency',fc,'SampleRate',fs,'TwoWayPropagation',true);

%%
% The raw data cube received by the physical array of the TDM MIMO radar
% can then be simulated as follows:

rng(2017);
Nsweep = 64;
Dn = 2;      % Decimation factor
fs = fs/Dn;
xr = complex(zeros(fs*waveform.SweepTime,Nr,Nsweep));

w0 = [0;1];  % weights to enable/disable radiating elements

for m = 1:Nsweep
    % Update radar and target positions
    [radar_pos,radar_vel] = radarmotion(waveform.SweepTime);
    [tgt_pos,tgt_vel] = carmotion(waveform.SweepTime);
    [~,tgt_ang] = rangeangle(tgt_pos,radar_pos);

    % Transmit FMCW waveform
    sig = waveform();
    txsig = transmitter(sig);
    
    % Toggle transmit element
    w0 = 1-w0; 
    txsig = txradiator(txsig,tgt_ang,w0);
    
    % Propagate the signal and reflect off the target
    txsig = channel(txsig,radar_pos,tgt_pos,radar_vel,tgt_vel);
    txsig = cars(txsig);
    
    % Dechirp the received radar return
    rxsig = rxcollector(txsig,tgt_ang);
    rxsig = receiver(rxsig);    
    dechirpsig = dechirp(rxsig,sig);
    
    % Decimate the return to reduce computation requirements
    for n = size(xr,2):-1:1
        xr(:,n,m) = decimate(dechirpsig(:,n),Dn,'FIR');
    end
end


%% Virtual Array Processing
% The data cube received by the physical array must be processed to form
% the virtual array data cube. For the TDM-MIMO radar system used in this
% example, the measurements corresponding to the two transmit antenna
% elements can be recovered from two consecutive sweeps by taking every
% other page of the data cube.

Nvsweep = Nsweep/2;
xr1 = xr(:,:,1:2:end);
xr2 = xr(:,:,2:2:end);

%%
% Now the data cube in |xr1| contains the return corresponding to the first
% transmit antenna element, and the data cube in |xr2| contains the return
% corresponding to the second transmit antenna element. Hence, the data
% cube from the virtual array can be formed as:

xrv = cat(2,xr1,xr2);

%%
% Next, perform range-Doppler processing on the virtual data cube. Because
% the range-Doppler processing is linear, the phase information is
% preserved. Therefore, the resulting response can be used later to perform
% further spatial processing on the virtual aperture.

nfft_r = 2^nextpow2(size(xrv,1));
nfft_d = 2^nextpow2(size(xrv,3));

rngdop = phased.RangeDopplerResponse('PropagationSpeed',c,...
    'DopplerOutput','Speed','OperatingFrequency',fc,'SampleRate',fs,...
    'RangeMethod','FFT','PRFSource','Property',...
    'RangeWindow','Hann','PRF',1/(Nt*waveform.SweepTime),...
    'SweepSlope',waveform.SweepBandwidth/waveform.SweepTime,...
    'RangeFFTLengthSource','Property','RangeFFTLength',nfft_r,...
    'DopplerFFTLengthSource','Property','DopplerFFTLength',nfft_d,...
    'DopplerWindow','Hann');

[resp,r,sp] = rngdop(xrv);

%%
% The resulting |resp| is a data cube containing the range-Doppler response
% for each element in the virtual array. As an illustration, the
% range-Doppler map for the first element in the virtual array is shown. 

plotResponse(rngdop,squeeze(xrv(:,1,:)));

%%
% The detection can be performed on the range-Doppler map from each pair of
% transmit and receive element to identify the targets in scene. In this
% example, a simple threshold-based detection is performed on the map
% obtained between the first transmit element and the first receive
% element, which corresponds to the measurement at the first element in the
% virtual array. Based on the range-Doppler map shown in the previous
% figure, the threshold is set at 10 dB below the maximum peak.

respmap = squeeze(mag2db(abs(resp(:,1,:))));
ridx = helperRDDetection(respmap,-10);
   
%%
% Based on the detected range of the targets, the corresponding range cuts
% can be extracted from the virtual array data cube to perform further
% spatial processing. To verify that the virtual array provides a higher
% resolution compared to the physical array, the code below extracts the
% range cuts for both targets and combines them into a single data matrix.
% The beamscan algorithm is then performed over these virtual array
% measurements to estimate the directions of the targets.

xv = squeeze(sum(resp(ridx,:,:),1))';

doa = phased.BeamscanEstimator('SensorArray',varray,'PropagationSpeed',c,...
    'OperatingFrequency',fc,'DOAOutputPort',true,'NumSignals',2,'ScanAngles',ang);
[Pdoav,target_az_est] = doa(xv);

fprintf('target_az_est = [%s]\n',num2str(target_az_est));

%%
% The two targets are successfully separated. The actual angles for the two
% cars are -10 and 10 degrees.

%%
% The next figure compares the spatial spectrums from the virtual and the
% physical receive array.
doarx = phased.BeamscanEstimator('SensorArray',rxarray,'PropagationSpeed',c,...
    'OperatingFrequency',fc,'DOAOutputPort',true,'ScanAngles',ang);
Pdoarx = doarx(xr);

helperPlotMultipledBPattern(ang,mag2db(abs([Pdoav Pdoarx])),[-30 0],...
    {'Virtual Array','Physical Array'},...
    'Spatial spectrum for virtual array and physical array',{'-','--'});

%%
% In this example, the detection is performed on the range-Doppler map
% without spatial processing of the virtual array data cube. This works
% because the SNR is high. If the SNR is low, it is also possible to
% process the virtual array blindly across the entire range-Doppler map to
% maximize the SNR before the detection.


%% Phase-Coded MIMO Radars
% Although a TDM-MIMO radar's processing chain is relatively simple, it
% uses only one transmit antenna at a time. Therefore, it does not take
% advantage of the full capacity of the transmit array. To improve the
% efficiency, there are other orthogonal waveforms that can be used in a
% MIMO radar.
%
% Using the same configuration as the example, one scheme to achieve
% orthogonality is to have one element always transmit the same FMCW
% waveform, while the second transmit element reverses the phase of the
% FMCW waveform for each sweep. This way both transmit elements are active
% in all sweeps. For the first sweep, the two elements transmit the same
% waveform, and for the second sweep, the two elements transmit the
% waveform with opposite phase, and so on. This is essentially coding the
% consecutive sweeps from different elements with a Hadamard code. It is
% similar to the Alamouti codes used in MIMO communication systems.
%
% MIMO radars can also adopt phase-coded waveforms in MIMO radar. In this
% case, each radiating element can transmit a uniquely coded waveform, and
% the receiver can then have a matched filter bank corresponding to each of
% those phase coded waveform. The signals can then be recovered and
% processed to form the virtual array.

%% Summary
% In this example, we gave a brief introduction to coherent MIMO radar and
% the virtual array concept. We simulated the return of a MIMO radar with a
% 2-element transmit array and a 4-element receive array and performed
% direction of arrival estimation of the simulated echos of two closely
% spaced targets using an 8-element virtual array.
